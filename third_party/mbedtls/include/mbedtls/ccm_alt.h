/**
 * \file ccm.h
 *
 * \brief This file provides an API for the CCM authenticated encryption
 *        mode for block ciphers.
 *
 * CCM combines Counter mode encryption with CBC-MAC authentication
 * for 128-bit block ciphers.
 *
 * Input to CCM includes the following elements:
 * <ul><li>Payload - data that is both authenticated and encrypted.</li>
 * <li>Associated data (Adata) - data that is authenticated but not
 * encrypted, For example, a header.</li>
 * <li>Nonce - A unique value that is assigned to the payload and the
 * associated data.</li></ul>
 *
 * Definition of CCM:
 * http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-38C/SP800-38C_updated-July20_2007.pdf
 * RFC 3610 "Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM)"
 *
 * Related:
 * RFC 5116 "An Interface and Algorithms for Authenticated Encryption"
 *
 * Definition of CCM*:
 * IEEE 802.15.4 - IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks
 * Integer representation is fixed most-significant-octet-first order and
 * the representation of octets is most-significant-bit-first order. This is
 * consistent with RFC 3610.
